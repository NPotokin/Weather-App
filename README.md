# Weather-App
Weather App built with React, TailwindCSS and few TBD libraries.  
The Idea is to create an app that would fetch (Axios) wearher data for inputed place/location  
and return data. Some of that data (forecast) will be used in conjunction with some (tbd) data  
visualisation library to build graps.  

## About:
The goals for the project are:
1. Improve fetching skills
2. Improve React Hooks skills
3. Improve libraries usage. 


## Tools:
