# Weather-App
Weather App built with React, TailwindCSS and few libraries.  
The Idea is to create an app that would fetch (Axios) wearher data for inputed place/location  
and return data. Some of that data (forecast) will be used in conjunction with some data  
visualisation library to build graps.
